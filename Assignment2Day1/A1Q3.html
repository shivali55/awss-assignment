        <h1>Data Types in JavaScript
            Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.
            
            There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:
             primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), 
            and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. 
            Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. 
            Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.
            
            Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can
             hold collections of values and more complex entities. Let's discuss each one of them in detail.</h1>
             <h2>
                The String Data Type
                The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:

                <script>
                var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
                var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes
             </script>
             </h2>
             <h2>
                The Number Data Type
                The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers
                 with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential 
                 notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).
                 <script>
                   var a = 25;         // integer
var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425  
                 </script>
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The Boolean Data Type
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. 
It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), 
on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:

Example
<script>
var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping
</script>
Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons in a program. 
The following example compares two variables and shows the result in an alert dialog box

                    The Object Data Type
                    The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
                    
                    An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. 
                    A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, 
                    like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, 
                    function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.
                    
                    The following example will show you the simplest way to create an object in JavaScript. 
                    <script>
                        var emptyObject = {};
var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};
 
// For better reading
var car = {
    "modal": "BMW X3",
    "color": "white",
    "doors": 5
}
                    </script>
                </h2>

                <h2>
                    The Array Data Type
An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.
 Each value (also called an element) 
in an array has a numeric position, 
known as its index, and it may contain data of any 
data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. 
The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].

The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a 
comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets, as shown in the example below:
<script>
    var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 
alert(colors[0]);   // Output: Red
alert(cities[2]);   // Output: New York
</script>
                </h2>
                <h2>

                The Function Data Type
The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below:

Example
<script>
var greeting = function(){ 
    return "Hello World!"; 
}
 
// Check the type of greeting variable
alert(typeof greeting) // Output: function
alert(greeting());     // Output: Hello World!
</script>
In fact, functions can be used at any place any other value can be used. 
Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed 
as arguments to other functions, 
and functions can be returned from functions. Consider the following function:
