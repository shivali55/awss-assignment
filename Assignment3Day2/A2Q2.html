            <script>
                var str1 = "Hello ";
                var str2 = "world!";

            </script>

         <h2>
            3.The match() method searches a string for a match against a regular expression, 
            and returns the matches, as an Array object.
            <script>
                var str = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain";
                var res = str.match(/ain/g);

                 alert(str.trim());
             </script>
         </h2>

         <h2>
            5.The includes() method determines whether a string contains the characters of a specified string.
            This method returns true if the string contains the characters, and false if not.
            <script>
                var str = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
                var n = str.includes("world");

            6.The localeCompare() method compares two strings in the current locale.

            after or is equal as the compareString in sort order.
            <script>
                var str1 = "ab";
                var str2 = "cd";
                var n = str1.localeCompare(str2);
            </script>
